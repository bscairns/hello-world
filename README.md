Hello World!

I am human, I think. I'm learning ruby, node.js, and brushing back up on my java from college that I didn't use in an official capacity during my ongoing 15 year career with Cisco UC/UCCE. I work for a college. You might not have heard of us, but we are superhero status. Kind of like the Avengers. I want to keep my job so I'm diving into the world of cloud communications in an effort to modernize the university's communications strategy. This in turn may lend to my tasting of moon tacos. I love Earth tacos, so if moon tacos are truly superior to my terrestrial counterparts I'm going to need a lot more money to get to the moon's pink taco stand.
